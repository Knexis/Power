# Power
To the people.

## OverView
Each of the 10 regions of Ghana are divided into districts and districts into  275 constituencies. Assigned to each constituency is a Member of Parliament voted into power by the people to oversee the development of his/her constituency.
        Power is a crowd-sourced way of rating the various facilities provided in a constituency eg: Water supply, Sanitation, Electricity and Roads to make it clear what the constituency is lacking so the Members of Parliament can focus on such facilities. 
       As a social enterprise whose only means of finance currently is ads placed in the app, Power hopes to rely heavily on donations from individuals to help cater for server and development costs. Donations can also be in the form of contributions to this Open Source project on GitHub (Will be made available on the launch date)[ https://github.com/Knexis/Power/wiki ].
       So in one sentence Power is an open source, social enterprise whose goal is to publicly hold Members of Parliament accountable for overseeing the development of their constituencies for a better Ghana through the input from people these constituencies.
       Power to the people built by the people.
