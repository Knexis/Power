# Power
In our modern society with everyone busy doing their own thing and no time to attend assembly meetings, how does a Member of Parliament know exactly what facilities of his/her constituency should be concentrated on in order to make it a better place?   I looked around and found out that some radio stations host shows that give people the opportunity to voice out what is happening in their neighbourhood. This is great but I realized that does not scale because whatever the people voice out can not be measured and made reference to as the basis to kickstart the resolution of the problem, because the end goal is not to just resolve the problem of one person but that of the entire constituency. So we need a system that can collate the suggestions of majority of the people in the constituency so that what is to be resolved is made clear.  Power does just that by pointing out clearly what facilities in the constituency need immediate improvement and those that are good enough. Power is able to do this by averaging the ratings from the people of a constituency on a scale of 1 to 5. 1 being Terrible and 5 being Great. So a constituency with very bad water supply can end up with a score of 1.0 under Water Supply. This same constituency can have a score of 4.6 for Sanitation. In this case it is quite clear where the Member of Parliamentâ€™s attention should be headed in terms of improving the living conditions of the people.
